# NitromeGameSDKs
Hello, this repository contains SDKs for some Nitrome games, I made some modifications so that it works without internet access and can play with a maximum of 4 players again.

What do I need to play? You will need a Flash emulator, I recommend <a href="https://ruffle.rs/" target="_blank">Ruffle Desktop</a>, then download it and the game's SDK file to play.

The controls for each player are configured as:
Control 1: 
Right Arrow -> Right
Left Arrow  -> Left
Up Arrow    -> Up
Down Arrow  -> Down
Space -> Action

Control 2: 
D -> Right
A -> Left
W -> Up
S -> Down
Q -> Action

Control 3:
L -> Right
J -> Left
I -> Up
K -> Down
H -> Action

Control 4:
Numpad 6 -> Right
Numpad 4 -> Left
Numpad 8 -> Up
Numpad 2 -> Down
Numpad 0 -> Action
